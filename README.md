ðŸš€ About Me

Iâ€™m a third-year Computer Science student passionate about the intersection of technology, knowledge systems, cultural preservation, and mental health. Iâ€™m drawn to questions about how we can design responsible, community-centered technologiesâ€”especially as AI/ML reshape society in this era of profound transformation.

As an AI/ML Fellow at Cornell Tech, Iâ€™ve gained hands-on experience in exploratory data analysis, model building, and deployment, while reflecting on the ethical, social, and cultural dimensions of the systems we create. My perspective is shaped by a transnational consciousness and my lived experience as a second-generation immigrant, grounding my work in values of equity, empathy, and care.

Iâ€™m especially curious about emerging technologies like large language models and their potential to both empower and challenge communities. I see technology not just as a set of tools, but as a deeply social forceâ€”one that can be shaped toward more connected, culturally aware, and inclusive futures.


- âš¡ Fun fact: I practice yoga and meditation, and I speak Sanskrit!
- ðŸŒ± Recently completed a specialization in Computational Social Science.

  ## Recent Projects
1. Bias Evaluation in Gemini-API [[Link to GitHub Project](https://github.com/Meenakshi2004/Relativity-Project-Bias-Evaluation-in-GeminiAPI)]
- In this project, my team and I worked on identifying and investigating potential harms of generative AI in the justice system, focusing on how biases in frontier models impact text analysis, using Amazon's Generalized Fairness Metrics dataset. I evaluated GenAI prompts with a focus on quantifying and detecting religious bias.
2. Exploring Demographic Bias in Income Prediction: An Analysis of US and Non-US Native Groups [[Link to GitHub Project](https://github.com/Meenakshi2004/Relativity-Project-Bias-Evaluation-in-GeminiAPI)]
- This project tackles a binary classification ML problem - utilizing the 1994 Census dataset to predict income levels, specifically classifying whether an individual's income is less than or greater than or equal to $50K. The primary focus is on analyzing how different demographic groups, particularly US-native versus non-US-native individuals, are represented within the dataset.
