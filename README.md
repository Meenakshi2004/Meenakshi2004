ðŸš€ About Me

Iâ€™m a Computer Science undergraduate passionate about the potential of technology to foster a more equitable and compassionate world. My interests span machine learning, data science, and AI ethics, with a particular focus on addressing the social harms of AI and understanding the deeper connections between technology, society, and humanity.

Iâ€™m also deeply inspired by ways of knowing that center mental wellness, interconnectedness, spirituality, and healingâ€”principles often found in Indigenous wisdom and decolonial perspectives. I believe that reclaiming and integrating these approaches can guide us toward creating technologies and systems that support both individual flourishing and collective well-being, addressing the deep pain and inequities that persist in our world.

As an AI/ML Fellow at Cornell Tech, Iâ€™ve developed skills in exploratory data analysis and model deployment, while grappling with the ethical complexities of the systems we build. These experiences fuel my aspiration to contribute to a society where technology serves as a tool for holistic progress, always through a lens that prioritizes fairness, inclusivity, and safety.

- âš¡ Fun fact: I'm a practitioner of yoga & meditation, and am a Sanskrit speaker!
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning about Computational Social Science

  ## Recent Projects
1. Bias Evaluation in Gemini-API [[Link to GitHub Project](https://github.com/Meenakshi2004/Relativity-Project-Bias-Evaluation-in-GeminiAPI)]
- In this project, my team and I worked on identifying and investigating potential harms of generative AI in the justice system, focusing on how biases in frontier models impact text analysis, using Amazon's Generalized Fairness Metrics dataset. I evaluated GenAI prompts with a focus on quantifying and detecting religious bias.
2. Exploring Demographic Bias in Income Prediction: An Analysis of US and Non-US Native Groups [[Link to GitHub Project](https://github.com/Meenakshi2004/Relativity-Project-Bias-Evaluation-in-GeminiAPI)]
- This project tackles a binary classification ML problem - utilizing the 1994 Census dataset to predict income levels, specifically classifying whether an individual's income is less than or greater than or equal to $50K. The primary focus is on analyzing how different demographic groups, particularly US-native versus non-US-native individuals, are represented within the dataset.
