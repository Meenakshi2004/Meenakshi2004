ðŸš€ About Me

I'm an undergraduate Computer Science student passionate about leveraging technology to foster a more sustainable, compassionate, and equitable world. My interests lie at the intersection of technology, society, and cultureâ€”shaped by a transnational consciousness and my lived experience as a second-generation immigrant.

I'm especially curious about the ethical development of emerging technologies like artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning (ML), and large language models (LLMs). I approach these tools not just as technical innovations, but as deeply social systems with real-world impactsâ€”particularly in the areas of mental wellness, equity, and collective healing. Deeply inspired by frameworks rooted in Indigenous knowledge and spirituality, I believe in designing technology with care, interconnectedness, and responsibility. I see this work as an opportunity to reimagine systems that prioritize community, empathy, and safety.

As an AI/ML Fellow at Cornell Tech, Iâ€™ve gained hands-on experience in exploratory data analysis, model building, and deploymentâ€”while continuously reflecting on the ethical, social, and cultural dimensions of the systems we create.

  ## Recent Projects
1. Bias Evaluation in Gemini-API [[Link to GitHub Project](https://github.com/Meenakshi2004/Relativity-Project-Bias-Evaluation-in-GeminiAPI)]
- In this project, my team and I worked on identifying and investigating potential harms of generative AI in the justice system, focusing on how biases in frontier models impact text analysis, using Amazon's Generalized Fairness Metrics dataset. I evaluated GenAI prompts with a focus on quantifying and detecting religious bias.
2. Exploring Demographic Bias in Income Prediction: An Analysis of US and Non-US Native Groups [[Link to GitHub Project](https://github.com/Meenakshi2004/Relativity-Project-Bias-Evaluation-in-GeminiAPI)]
- This project tackles a binary classification ML problem - utilizing the 1994 Census dataset to predict income levels, specifically classifying whether an individual's income is less than or greater than or equal to $50K. The primary focus is on analyzing how different demographic groups, particularly US-native versus non-US-native individuals, are represented within the dataset.
