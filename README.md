🚀 About Me

I’m a third-year Computer Science student passionate about the intersection of technology, knowledge systems, dharmā, and mental health. I’m drawn to questions about how we can design responsible, community-centered technologies—especially as AI/ML reshape society in this era of profound transformation.

As an AI/ML Fellow at Cornell Tech, I’ve gained hands-on experience in exploratory data analysis, model building, and deployment, while reflecting on the ethical, social, and cultural dimensions of the systems we create. My perspectives are shaped by pluralistic worldviews and journey as a second-generation immigrant.

I’m especially curious about emerging technologies like large language models and their potential to both empower and challenge communities. I see technology not just as a set of tools, but as a catalyst to shaping toward more connected, culturally aware, and inclusive futures, once used responsibly.


- ⚡ Fun fact: I practice yoga and meditation, and I speak Sanskrit!
- 🌱 Recently completed a specialization in Computational Social Science.
- 😄 Pronouns: she/her


  ## Recent Projects
1. Bias Evaluation in Gemini-API [[Link to GitHub Project](https://github.com/Meenakshi2004/Relativity-Project-Bias-Evaluation-in-GeminiAPI)]
- In this project, my team and I worked on identifying and investigating potential harms of generative AI in the justice system, focusing on how biases in frontier models impact text analysis, using Amazon's Generalized Fairness Metrics dataset. I evaluated GenAI prompts with a focus on quantifying and detecting religious bias.
2. Exploring Demographic Bias in Income Prediction: An Analysis of US and Non-US Native Groups [[Link to GitHub Project](https://github.com/Meenakshi2004/Relativity-Project-Bias-Evaluation-in-GeminiAPI)]
- This project tackles a binary classification ML problem - utilizing the 1994 Census dataset to predict income levels, specifically classifying whether an individual's income is less than or greater than or equal to $50K. The primary focus is on analyzing how different demographic groups, particularly US-native versus non-US-native individuals, are represented within the dataset.


  ## 💻 Technologies & Tools
